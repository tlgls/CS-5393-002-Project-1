## Library Management System
### Objectives:
We implemented a library management system that utilizes various data structures:
queues, stacks, hash tables, and a binary search tree. We utilized the queue for book
reservations, of which we reserved 10 books and displayed it, as well as reserving two
of the same books and displaying the next availability. We then used a stack to track
the recently borrowed books, then returned the above book reserved by two people
and lent it out later in the main class. We then also implemented a search functionality
by using the binary search tree (BST).
